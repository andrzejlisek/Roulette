* *100 roulette* \- Roulette with 100 numbers, zero and card suits, which has the same rules as the zero\.

If the zero or special symbol is hit, all outside bets \(odd/even, low/high, red/black, dozens, columns, snake\) are lost as a whole\. In the *Mini roulette*, if zero is hit, the player loses only half of value of the bets, which excludes the zero\. There is reason, why in the *Mini roulette* all bets must have even value\.

# Chip value factor

Roulette allows wide range of bet values, so the value of one chip can be set by value factor per one chip\. You can change the value factor by clicking **F\+** and **F\-** from 1 do 1 billion in the power of 10 steps\. You cannot place several bets in wider range than four order of magnitude due to 10000 chips limit per place, but you can increase the bet value by increasing the value factor\. The real bet value \(including the factor\) are displayed as the **Bet** value\.

# Wheel in the *100 roulette*

The wheel in the *100 roulette* has 105 symbols \(numbers from 1 to 100, zero and four card suits\)\. The 105 units on the wheel circumference will be to narrow to click using the finger and to show chip value\. The wheel is splited to three parts, because 3 is one of divisors of 105 and on the circumference there are only 35 units\. The splitting point is indicated by white radial placed line\. If you look for the numbers clockwise \(when the wheel not rotates\), the parts are ordered from outer, through the middle, to inner, and the inner part passes to the outer part\.

You can place the chips only on symbols, which are on the most outer parts\. After symbol click, the splitting point will be places on the opposite place related to clicked symbol\.

If you want to click one of the symbols, which is currently on the middle part or inner part, you have to click anywhere on the middle or inner part to move the part to the outer part\. The splitting line will be placed on the opposite side related to the clicked symbol\.

# Spinning the wheel

The game provides the three wheel spinning modes, which can be switched by clicking the **STD** button, which changes the caption against the current mode\. There are available the following modes:


* **STD** \- Standard mode\. The wheel will automatically choose any of all available numbers or symbols, including zero or card suit\.
* **NO\-0** \- Non\-zero mode\. The mode elliminates the house edge, wheel will automatically choose any number excluding the zero or card suit, despite this, you can place bets including the zero or card suit, but the zero or card suit will never be hit\.
* **SEL** \- Selection mode\. The randomization is turned off and the player have to select the winning number by clicking the number of the table or on the wheel\. This mode is for test and educational purposes\.
* **PROB** \- Display win and lose probability for current player instead of spinning the wheel\.

To spin the wheel, click on the the right 2/3 part of information bar, where are the **Chip**, **Last**, **Factor** and **Bet** values\. During the wheel spinning all functions excepting the screen layout and selecting the number in **SEL** mode are disabled\. If the wheel spinning mode is set to **SEL**, choose the wining number by clicking on the wheel on on the table\.

After the winning number is determined by random in the **STD** or **NO\-0** mode or by choosing in **SEL** mode, the balance for every player will be automatically changed by the winning or losing value\. The value will be displayed as the **Last** value\. The current player selection does not affect the spinning process and result\.

The winning bets will left on the table and the other bets will be removed\. The game round ends on this\. After that, the next round begins and, you and the other players can again place the bet and spin the wheel\. You can use **CLR** button to clear placed chips\. If the table is blank, this button will set the same bets, which was set in previous round\.

The number of rounds are not limited, everytime in placing bet state, a player can be added or removed\. At the next to the wheel there are the 12 last hit number, the last number is highlighted in the bar\.

# Win/lose probability

In the **PROB** wheel spinning mode, you can show the probability of win and lose information instead of the wheel spin\. The information consists of two tables, which shows the information for the current player:


* **Result probability** \- Each win \(positive, green background\) or lose \(negative, red background\) value possible at the current bet for **STD** and **NO\-0** modes\. The probability is shown as fraction \(exact probability\) and percentage \(rounded to 1 percent point\)\.
* **Result for each number** \- The round result for each number, which can be hit\. In the **NO\-0** mode the 0 number cannot be hit and there is the only difference between **STD** and **NO\-0**\.

# Payout

In each game, the payout ratio depends on count of numbers excluding the zero and card suits, which equals to number os possible hits when you playing oin **NO\-0** mode\. The other elements, on which payout ratio depends, is the counts of numbers, which beat covers\.

Exactly, the payout radio can be calculated from the following formula: P = \(\(N / X\) \- 1\)


* P \- Payout ratio\.
* N \- Count of available numbers excluding the zero and card suits \(available in **NO\-0** mode\)\.
* X \- Count of numbers \(or numbers and card suits totally in *100 roulette*\) covered by bet\.

Some payout radios calculated from above formula are not integer value\. Every such radio is rounded down to integer and markered as italic in the following bet payout ratio table\.

| Bet | Classic | Mini | 100 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Straight | 35:1 | 11:1 | 99:1 |
| Split | 17:1 | 5:1 | 49:1 |
